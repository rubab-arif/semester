                        Dogs Don't Have Full Bladder Capacity Until They Are Approximately 12 Months Of Age. Give Your
                        Dog Plenty Of Opportunities To Go To The Toilet In An Appropriate Place. Take Them Out When They
                        Wake Up, After Every Meal, After Playtime, Before Bed, Before You Leave Them And When You Come
                        Back, And Then Every 45 Minutes.</p>

                                Tearstains In The Lower Corners Of Their Eyes. Tearstains Are Most Often Caused By The
